I created this project during my time as a Coding Mentor for Grand Circus's Apple Foundations classes. I used this XCode project to demonstrate a few different concepts:

1. Using a tab bar and Navigation View (or Navigation Stack)
2. Using structs to create a reusable View file
3. using Model files to store and display data

NOTE: On the next update I'm going to refactor the code so that it's MVVM structure. The Model and View files are already created.
